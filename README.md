## ------- Datapack & Resource Pack-------------------------------
 - Download the second file in the versions tab. (Should look like `trims_overhaul-DP_RP-vX.X.X.zip`)

<br>

 - For the data pack; Open your world folder (`.minecraft/saves/world`)
   - Drop the zip into the `datapacks` folder as-is
   - Then restart the server or world — /reload won't work
    - When updating; don't disable the datapack, otherwise some progress will be lost.

<br>
  
 - For the resource pack; In Minecraft, go to Options > Resource Packs
   - Then drag the new zip file into your Minecraft
   - And click on the arrow on the new pack to enable it.

<br>

## -- Mod (Bundle for mod loaders) ----
 - May vary depending on your loader, but simply
  download the first file in the versions tab,
  and then drag it into your mods folder, usually
  located at `.minecraft/mods`. Possibly
  accessible through any "mods" button ingame
 - The previous `.zip` can be renamed to `.jar`, which'll instead make it work as a mod.
